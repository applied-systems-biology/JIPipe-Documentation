On starting JIPipe, you will be presented with a <ui-path>Getting started</ui-path> screen. It allows you
to quickly open a recent project, begin creating a new pipeline, and access a variety of additional links and information.

<deflist>
<def title="%c1% Recent projects list">
Here you can find the list of recent projects. Double-click a file to load the project in the current or a new JIPipe window. 
Additionally, you can also find here a list of example projects.
</def>
<def title="%c2% Quick start buttons">
These buttons allow you to either quickly get to the <a href="Pipeline-editor.topic">workflow editor</a> screen or load an existing project.

</def>
<def title="%c3% Helpful links">
A list of helpful links are displayed at the bottom left. Each will go to a website.
<note>
Due to a bug in the Java version provided by ImageJ, clicking the links might not always work on all systems. In this case,
you can also find all links on the <a href="https://www.jipipe.org/">JIPipe homepage</a>.
