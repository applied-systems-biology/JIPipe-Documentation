# ImageJ update site

<warning>
While we provide JIPipe via the ImageJ update site system, we highly recommend to use a <i>prepackaged</i> version of our software.
The reason behind this is that JIPipe requires a variety of ImageJ plugins to work properly. 
Those are by default not provided by the Fiji distribution of ImageJ and may yield in a non-functional JIPipe installation.
</warning>
<warning>Please do <strong>not</strong> combine the ImageJ Update Site package with the <a href="Manual-installation.md">manually installed JAR files</a>. 
The files may conflict and will cause errors.</warning>
