# Manual installation

<note>We provide JAR files that can be manually installed into an existing ImageJ instance. This is different from using the ImageJ Updater.</note>
<warning>We highly recommend to only use our prepackaged JIPipe versions if possible, as JIPipe requires a variety of ImageJ plugins to work propertly. 
Those are not provided with the JAR package.</warning>
<warning>Please do <strong>not</strong> enable the JIPipe update site while using a manually installed plugin. 
The files may conflict and will cause errors.</warning>
